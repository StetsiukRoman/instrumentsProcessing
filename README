To execute this code run the script:
./start.sh

For tests execution:
./startTests.sh

Technologies used: Java 8, Spring Data, Mongo, JUnit, Guava.

If we want to process really big amount of data, we should use appropriate instruments.
Big Data technologies may be to expensive.
I'll prefer lucine-based engines, like ElasticSearch, where we can easily create many statistics wth UI (using Kibana).

But for this task I used mongoDB, because It's easier hear and using aggregation module from mongo we can calculate many statistics on DB
level without unnecessary queries and data transferring to our application.

I used embedded mongoDB to simplify delivering of this application.

Program architecture allows to add new statistics algorithm (both onthegly and relayed) easily.

Possible improvements:
1) Move all hardcoded info to spring cloud.
2) Use real mongo, not embedded for production.
3) Process data in several threads.
For now It doesn't give any performance win, because of only one connection to embedded mongoDB.
Profiling with simple timer.
