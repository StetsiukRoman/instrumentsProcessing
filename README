To execute this code run the script:
./start.sh

For tests execution:
./startTests.sh

Technologies used: Java 8, Spring Data, Mongo, JUnit, Guava.

If we want to process really big amount of data, we should use appropriate instruments.
Big Data technologies may be to expensive.
I'll prefer lucine-based engines, like ElasticSearch, where we can easily create many statistics wth UI (using Kibana).

Used mongoDB  because It's easier hear and using aggregation module from mongo we can calculate many statistics on DB
level without unnecessary queries and data transferring to our application.

Program architecture allows to add new statistics algorithm (both onthefly and delayed) easily.

Possible improvements:
1) Move all hardcoded info to spring cloud.
2) Use real mongo, not embedded for production.
3) Process data in several threads.
